ABSTRACTION



So which should you use, an Abstract class or an Interface?
The answer depends on whether your base class will have any
member variables or method bodies. If you want to provide those,
then you should create an abstract class. If your base class
is only there to define the methods that should be overridden, then
you should use an Interface.
